# SQL DIALECT RULES (MySQL/OceanBase)
- Always use backticks `` for table and column names to prevent keyword conflicts.
- Use column comments to understand data semantics.
- Prefer CTEs (Common Table Expressions) over complex nested subqueries for readability.
- Date format is strictly 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
